ðŸš€âœ¨AstralDB follows a simple dogma; vectors are stored as key-value pairs, and handles all the complexities for you. Vectors in ðŸš€âœ¨AstralDB are organised in 'Stores'. Thus, a vector is uniquely identified by a key and a store.

While I use the word 'vectors', in actuality any numpy array can be stored in ðŸš€âœ¨AstralDB.

Soon, features will be added for storing metadata along with the vectors as well.
